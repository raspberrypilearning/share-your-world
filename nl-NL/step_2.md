### Which part of your world would you like to share?

\--- task ---

Think about the purpose of your website: which part of your world would you like to show off?

Dat kan zijn:

- 🎊 Cultural – something from your culture: a festival, celebration, custom, or special location
- 😁 Hobbies – a favourite hobby or passtime: books, TV, movies, obsession, or fandom
- ⚽️ Sports – a sport you play or watch
- 👗 Fashion – styles, brands, trends, decades, or designers
- 💻 Tech – programming, computers, or the latest technology
- 📙 History – a piece or era of history: events, people, or places throughout time
- 🔬 Science – an area of research: studies, discoveries, recent or historical

**Tip:** Choose something that you are interested in. A part of your world that you can invite the user into.

You might want to build on the pages you made in [Pick your favourite](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/pick-your-favourite){:target="_blank"} or [Quiz time!](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/quiz-time){:target="_blank"} and create a larger website.
